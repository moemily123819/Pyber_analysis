### **About the data :**

Two sets of data were provided - city data and ride data.  They were merged to be analyzed.  After being merged, the columns were city name, date of the ride, fare, ride_id, driver_count and type of city.

Cities were classified into urban, suburban and rural.  The city types were the main focus of this analysis.  The total fares, total rides and total number of drivers by city category were computed and the results wouldl help the company to focus on how to strive in urban, suburban and rural areas.

 

### **About the python script :**

The python script uses :

- jupyter notebook,
- numpy,
- csv file processing, 
- pandas dataframes, 
- pandas merge,
- groupby,
- count(), mean(), value_counts(),
- pandas loc, 
- matplotlib - bubble chart and pie charts, with legends.  

The python script produces a bubble chart to show total number of rides and average fares among urban, suburban and rural areas.  Three pie charts are available for the percentage of each city type :

- total fares by city type,

-  total rides by city type,
- and total number of driver by city type.



### Deployment :

The python script, pyber.ipynb can be run in jupyter notebook.
